File Encryption using GnuPG

* Install on windows
$ winget install -e --id GnuPG.GnuPG

* on Linux
GnuPG (GPG) is included by default in most Linux distributions

$ gpg --gen-key
$ gpg -c FILENAME.txt (two files will be created (FILENAME.txt & FILENAME.txt.gpg))
$ rm FILENAME.txt (Remove the original unencrypted file)

Note that there was no passphrase prompt to decrypt the file.
If you want to be prompted to enter the password to decrypt the file again,
you'll have to wait ten minutes, which is the default timeout value.

To bypass this;

Create file gpg-agent.conf
* on Linux
~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

* on Windows
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\

$ cd <directory>
$ nano gpg-agent.conf

* Add this lines to the file
    default-cache-ttl 1
    max-cache-ttl 1

$ echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent
